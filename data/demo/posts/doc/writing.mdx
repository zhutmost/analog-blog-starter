Analog uses [Content Collections](https://content-collections.dev) to manage your content. It is a open-source tool that can transforms your content into type-safe data collections.

During the build process, Content Collections scans your content folders (`/data/{posts,authors,pages}`), and then convert the MDX files into JavaScript objects according to the configuration `/content-collection.ts`.
These objects are then used by Next.js to generate the HTML pages.

Analog uses the following content collections:

| Content        | Source Path                 | Target Route    | Layout Template                  |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Blog Posts     | `/data/posts/[slug].mdx`    | `/post/[slug]`  | `/src/layouts/post-layout.tsx`   |
| Default Author | `/data/authors/default.mdx` | `/about`        | `/src/layouts/author-layout.tsx` |
| Authors        | `/data/authors/[slug].mdx`  | `/about/[slug]` | `/src/layouts/author-layout.tsx` |
| General Pages  | `/data/pages/[slug].mdx`    | `/[slug]`       | `/src/layouts/page-layout.tsx`   |

For example, if you create a MDX file `/data/posts/sub/path/hello-world.mdx`, it will be available at `https://base.url/post/sub/path/hello-world`.

## Front Matter

The front matter is a YAML block at the top of your MDX file. It contains metadata about the content, such as the title, date, and tags.

### Blog Posts

The front matter for blog posts includes the following fields:

| Field              | Required (Default Value) | Description                                                                    |

| `tags`             | N (`[]`)                 | A list of tags for the post.                                                   |
| `banner`           | N (null)                 | The file name of the banner image. It should be in the local asset directory.  |

## Local Assests

Assets used within posts (such as images) should be placed under the `public` directory to ensure they are accessible after deployment.
However, storing MDX files and their associated assets in separate locations complicates asset management.

To address this, Analog allows users to create a folder with the same name as the MDX file to store related assets.
That is to say, you can reference an image directly as `abc.png` in your MDX file instead of using a lengthy path like `/images/posts/test/image-test/17-300x200-grayscale.jpg`.
During the build process, Content Collections will automatically copy the contents of this folder to the `public` directory and prepend the correct path prefix, ensuring seamless asset resolution.

For example, if you have a post file `/data/posts/sub/folder/hello-world.mdx`, you can create a folder named `hello-world` in the same directory as the post file (i.e., `/data/posts/sub/folder/hello-world`).
Then, you can place your images inside this folder and reference them in your MDX file.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can still use the `/public` directory to store your assets.
> Paths starting with `/` will be treated as assets in the `public` directory, and other internal paths will be treated as assets in the local asset folder.

## About MDX

MDX is a superset of Markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files.
If you are familiar with Markdown, you can think of MDX as Markdown with the ability to use React components.
For most cases, you can just write your content in Markdown syntax, and rename the file extension from `.md` to `.mdx`.

You can also insert React components in your MDX files to implement complex features. In the post [Image Test](/post/test/image-test), you can find a case where we use the `figure` component to insert a blurred images.

The official MDX documentation is [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/). The post [MDX Style Demo](/post/test/markdown-style) shows some MDX examples in Analog.
