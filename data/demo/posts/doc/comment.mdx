Analog supports [Giscus](https://giscus.app) comment system, which is built on top of GitHub Discussions.
Now, let's demonstrate how to set it up.

## Setting Up Giscus

Giscus is a free and open-source project.

### Create a Giscus Instance

First, go to [Giscus](https://giscus.app) and set it up per the instructions.

Note that, please make sure that:
1. The target repository is [public](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public), otherwise visitors will not be able to view the discussion. The target repository can be the same as your blog's repository, or a separate one.
2. The [Giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) app is installed, otherwise visitors will not be able to comment and react.
3. The Discussions feature is turned on by [enabling it for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository).

If everything is set up correctly, it will generate a script code snippet for you, like this:

```html
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        data-repo="repo-owner/repo-name"
        data-repo-id="X_xxxxxxxxxx"
        data-category="Announcements"
        data-category-id="XXX_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        data-mapping="pathname"
        data-strict="0"
        data-reactions-enabled="1"
        data-emit-metadata="0"
        data-input-position="bottom"
        data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
        data-lang="en"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
```

### Configure Giscus in Analog

Next, fill in the corresponding `comment` fields in the user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts`:

```typescript
comment: {
  provider: 'giscus',
  giscusConfig: {
    repo: 'repo-owner/repo-name',
    repoId: 'X_xxxxxxxxxx',
    category: 'Announcements',
    categoryId: 'XXX_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    ...
  },
}
```

Now, you can see the Giscus comment widget at the bottom of your posts (just like this post).

## Setting Up Other Comment Systems

You can find other comment system components, such as Disqus and Utterances, from [timlrx/pliny/comments](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny/tree/main/packages/pliny/src/comments).
Just replace the component in the post layout file `/src/layouts/post-layout.tsx` with them.
